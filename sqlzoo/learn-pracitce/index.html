  <ul>
    <h2>1: Show first name, last name, and gender of patients whose gender is 'M'</h2>
    <p>
      WHERE Clause Example
      The following SQL statement selects all the patients with the gender "F", in the "patients" table:
      SELECT * FROM patients
      WHERE gender ='F';
    </p>
    <li>
      select first_name, last_name, gender
      from patients
      where gender = 'M'
    </li>
    <h2>2: Show first name and last name of patients who does not have allergies. (null)</h2>
    <p>
      A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.

      If a field in a table is optional, it is possible to insert a new record or update a record without adding a value
      to this field. Then, the field will be saved with a NULL value.

      How to Test for NULL Values?
      It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>.

        We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

        IS NULL Syntax
        SELECT column_names
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name IS NULL;
        <span></span>
    </p>
    <li>
      select first_name,
      last_name
      from patients
      where allergies is null
    </li>
    <h2>3: Show first name of patients that start with the letter 'C'</h2>
    <p>
      The following SQL statement selects all the patients with the gender "F", in the "patients" table:
      SELECT * FROM patients
      WHERE gender ='F';
      <span></span>
      SELECT * FROM patients
      WHERE first_name LIKE 'a%';
      -- First names starting with 'a'.
      -- View sql patterns for more info.
    </p>
    <li>
      SELECT first_name
      FROM patients
      where first_name like 'C%'
    </li>
  </ul>
